If you don't feel like opening the schematic, here it is in text:
```
GPIO 18 ---------------------------------,
                                         |
                                          |-  Button
                                         |                  ~2.2Kâ„¦
GPIO 19 ---------------------------------'----------------/\/\/\/\/\----------> Probe

```

And with this thing and a Jumperess, you can do this:
